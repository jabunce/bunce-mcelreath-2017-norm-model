contains files relating to 2017 model of interaction benefit asymmetries and cultural change 

``Asymmetry_model_analytical_solutions``: Mathematica workbook with derivations of Eqs 11 and 8.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs``: Mathematica workbook with model simulations and numerical solutions. Generates figures 2, 3, and 4 in manuscript. Fig 2 can take several hours to run, but you can adjust model parameter values to show less detail so it runs faster (suggestions in workbook).

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_bias``: Mathematica workbook with model simulations allowing biased selection of visitors from a minority group with a restricted-access homeland. Makes fig 7 in appendix.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_markers``: Mathematica workbook with simulations of a model in which each individual has both a norm and a marker, allowing people to assort on marker. Makes fig 8 in appendix.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_groupassort``: Mathematica workbook with simulations of a model allowing people to assort on both group affiliation and norm. Makes figs 5 and 6 in appendix. Fig 5 can take several hours to run, but you can adjust model parameter values to show less detail so it runs faster (suggestions in workbook).
