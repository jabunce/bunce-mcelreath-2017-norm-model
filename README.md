Sustainability of minority culture when inter-ethnic interaction is profitable
John Bunce and Richard McElreath

The original preprint is on SocArXiv [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bpgt3/)


A revised version is currently in press at Nature Human Behaviour


Figure and equation numbers below and in the notebooks refer to the original pre-print on SocArXiv, which has an attached appendix. In the published article, some of the figures and equations change numbers, and the appendix is turned into Supplementary Materials.   

``Asymmetry_model_analytical_solutions``: Mathematica notebook with derivations of Eqs 11 and 8.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs``: Mathematica notebook with model simulations and numerical solutions. Generates figures 2 in the manuscript and figures 3 and 4 in appendix. Fig 2 can take several hours to run, but you can adjust model parameter values to show less detail so it runs faster (suggestions in notebook).

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_bias``: Mathematica notebook with model simulations allowing biased selection of visitors from a minority group with a restricted-access homeland. Makes fig 7 in appendix.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_markers``: Mathematica notebook with simulations of a model in which each individual has both a norm and a marker, allowing people to assort on marker. Makes fig 8 in appendix.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_groupassort``: Mathematica notebook with simulations of a model allowing people to assort on both group affiliation and norm. Makes figs 5 and 6 in appendix. Fig 5 can take several hours to run, but you can adjust model parameter values to show less detail so it runs faster (suggestions in notebook).


A simpler one-patch model was added during the peer-review process, and thus does not appear in the pre-print on SocArXiv. The figure and equation numbers below refer to the Supplementary Materials that accompany the published article.

``Asymmetry_model_analytical_solutions_onepatch``: Mathematica notebook with derivations of Eqs S.3, S.7-S.9, and S.11-S.13 in Supplementary Material for simpler one-patch model.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_onepatch``: Mathematica notebook with model simulations for simpler one-patch model. Makes Supplementary Figure 2 in Supplementary Materials.
