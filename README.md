contains files relating to 2017 model of resource asymmetries and cultural change 

``Asymmetry_model_analytical_solutions.nb``: Mathematica notebook with derivations of Eqs 11 and 8.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs.nb``: Mathematica notebook with model simulations and numerical solutions. Generates figures 2, 3, and 4. Figs 3 and 4 can take several hours to run, but you can adjust figure parameter values to show less detail so they run faster (suggestions in notebook).

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_bias.nb``: Mathematica notebook with model simulations allowing biased selection of visitors from a minority group with a restricted-access homeland. Makes fig 5.

``Asymmetry_model_sim_equilibs_markers.nb``: Mathematica notebook with simulations of a model in which each individual has both a norm and a marker, allowing people to assort on marker. Makes fig 6.
